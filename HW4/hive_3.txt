Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.\x0A\x0AI would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.\x0A\x0ACommunication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.\x0A\x0AIf you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.\x0A\x0AHappy New Year\x0A\x0ALouise

 allen-p/22. column=body:body, timestamp=2022-06-11T16:46:43.549, value=Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same\x0Alevel of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You\x0Asay that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I\x0Ajust did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost\x0Awas about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we\x0Acan discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90\x0Aper sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the\x0Atrue custom home level but should be achievable with good management.\x0ARichard Morgan\x0AManager, Green Building Program\x0AAustin Energy\x0A721 Barton Springs Rd.\x0AAustin, TX 78704-1194\x0APh. 512.505.3709\x0AFax 512.505.3711\x0Ae-mail richard.morgan@austinenergy.com\x0A\x0A\x0A-----Original Message-----\x0AFrom: Allen, Phillip K. [mailto:Phillip.K.Allen@ENRON.com]\x0ASent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 9:19 AM\x0ATo: Morgan, Richard\x0ASubject:\x0A\x0A\x0ARichard,\x0A\x0AI spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with\x0ASIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can\x0Adecide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints\x0Acompleted.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with\x0A8.5" roof panels and use a metal roof.\x0A\x0AI have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that\x0Ais also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of\x0A$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within\x0Athat budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built\x0Ahouse.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a\x0Aradiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same\x0Aenergy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to\x0Aa sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.\x0AThat would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional\x0Acosts for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?\x0ADo you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help\x0Ame construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from\x0AWink with Premier based on you reference.\x0A\x0AThank you for your help.\x0A\x0APhillip Allen\x0Apallen@enron.com\x0A713-853-7041\x0A\x0A\x0A**********************************************************************\x0AThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and\x0Amay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the\x0Aintended recipient (s).

Please let me know how you wish to handle this and I will proceed.\x0A\x0AAdditionally, it is getting close to closing. I will need to get contracts signed at this point as soon as possible. We can handle this in two ways. I prefer that you elect me as a Vice - President of the General Partner and then I will sign all documents, or I can Federal Express contracts (this is more difficult).\x0A\x0AI have a funeral at 10:00 and I will be back about 1:00.

 allen-p/62. column=body:body, timestamp=2022-06-11T16:46:43.467, value=Phillip,\x0A\x0AThis section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event.  The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.\x0A\x0AAs you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.\x0A\x0AThanks,\x0A\x0ARenee\x0A\x0A -----Original Message-----\x0AFrom: \x09Allen, Phillip K.  \x0ASent:\x09Thursday, November 01, 2001 8:26 AM\x0ATo:\x09Ratcliff, Renee\x0ASubject:\x09\x0A\x0ARenee,\x0A\x0AThank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads "The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock."  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.\x0A\x0AThank you,\x0A\x0APhillip Allen

The problems that we are seeing are one of three (3)\x0Apossibilities:\x0A\x0A1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was\x0Athe correct password) and been given the error message that you have\x0Aexceeded your opportunities for today, and you receive the message "You\x0Ahave failed to correctly login three times today; please try again\x0Atomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password\x0Areset." This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one\x0Aquickly with you online (on the phone). Should you receive this message,\x0Aplease call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard\x0AGordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @\x0A830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please\x0Aleave your Name, Account # and call back #.\x0A\x0A2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the\x0Assn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the\x0Alast six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the\x0Aprimary account holder.\x0A\x0A3)  If you see this error message "Invalid login; please try again"\x0A(after three [3] or more tries), then you possibly fall into this last\x0Acategory. Your account is one of the few that did not convert correctly\x0A(we will not release any information about these accounts until we\x0Averify that all information is correct and accurate). We are finalizing\x0Athese accounts today and should have them available for access this\x0Aafternoon (late) or this evening. Once we release these accounts for IBS\x0Aaccess, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#\x0A(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will\x0Abe directed to a screen that asks for information such as:\x0A\x0AName\x0AAddress\x0ACity, State Zip+4\x0APhone #\x0AE-Mail Address\x0A\x0AAfter entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be\x0Ainstructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can\x0Aat this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always\x0Aremember that your password is case sensitive.\x0A\x0AShould you get into IBS (before early evening [6:00pm]), the balance and\x0Atransactional information displayed is as of 11/16/01 (Friday night). We\x0Awill have this information updated by 6:00pm (hopefully), and then\x0Ainformation will be as of Monday (11/19/01).

The main\x0Adifference is that we need to get the list of SMEs by 11/28, instead of\x0A11/30.  By 11/30, we need to have contacted the SMEs and set up time with\x0Athem for the following week. I think that to contact 10 SMEs will take at\x0Aleast 2 days, especially since one of the days is a Friday.\x0A\x0A(11/26-11/28)\x0A                         --Obtain contact information for expert story SMEs\x0A(11/28-11/30)\x0A                         --Contact SMEs to give them background regarding\x0Athe simulation, describe their role in the simulation, set up a time to\x0Adiscuss ideas, and set up a time for video shoot.\x0A(12/3-12/6)\x0A               --Meet with SMEs to discuss the categories of content we\x0Aneed and where they can provide stories.\x0A                          --Send follow-up e-mail asking SMEs to review the\x0Astories (questions and answers) that we will ask them during the video\x0Ashoot.\x0A                          --Make changes to stories, if necessary.\x0A                          --Send final stories and video shoot logistics to\x0ASMEs\x0A(12/10-12/12)\x0A                          --Video shoot\x0A\x0APlease let me know if you have any questions.\x0A\x0AThanks,\x0AAnn\x0A\x0A\x0A\x0AThis message is for the designated recipient only and may contain\x0Aprivileged, proprietary, or otherwise private information.

 allen-p/66. column=body:body, timestamp=2022-06-11T16:46:43.073, value=Michelle\x0AHere are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).\x0A\x0ASheri\x0A\x0AWhen you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a "Dateline" type theme for one, and a "60 Minute" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)? \x0A\x0A\x0A \x0A\x0ACheers Kirk\x0A---------------------- Forwarded by Kirk McDaniel/HOU/EES on 11/27/2001 09:31 AM ---------------------------\x0A\x0A\x0AKirk McDaniel\x0A11/27/2001 01:41 AM\x0ATo:\x09Michelle Cash/Enron@EnronXGate\x0Acc:\x09Tim O'Rourke/Enron@EnronXGate, Yevgeny Frolov/Enron@EnronXGate, mery.l.brown@accenture.com, laura.a.de.la.torre@accenture.com, donald.l.barnhart@accenture.com \x0ASubject:\x09RM Simulation Storyline Scripts - Ready for Legal Review\x0A\x0AMichelle\x0A\x0AThanks for your support of the BRM project.

 allen-p/73. column=body:body, timestamp=2022-06-11T16:46:43.484, value=Phillip, the insurance/repairs numbers are actually overstated; they are based on calculations from USPSL owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.\x0A\x0AI have added another post office for your consideration. It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached.\x0A\x0AIn any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here. Do let me know what you've already found, and what you might like to find.

 allen-p/78. column=body:body, timestamp=2022-06-11T16:46:43.541, value=Wow!  this looks complicated.  let me get some help on this and get back to=\x0A you\x0A\x0A\x0A\x0A -----Original Message-----\x0AFrom: =09Allen, Phillip K. =20\x0ASent:=09Friday, November 16, 2001 8:38 AM\x0ATo:=09Whalley, Greg; Lavorato, John\x0ASubject:=09FW:=20\x0A\x0A\x0AGreg,\x0A\x0AAfter making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=\x0Aferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=\x0Aarding the Phantom Stock Account. =20\x0A\x0ASection 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=\x0Atribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=\x0Analty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =\x0Aof the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=\x0As of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=\x0Aceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=\x0A of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=\x0A of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=\x0Arators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=\x0As a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=\x0Aock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=\x0Ares in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=\x0An several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=\x0Aat the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=\x0Af Enron Corp. common stock.\x0A\x0AThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=\x0A  section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=\x0A"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=\x0Actions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=\x0At apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distrib=\x0Aution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts" indicates that one pay=\x0Ament will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\x0A\x0AThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =\x0Ais the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=\x0Ahe Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states "The val=\x0Aue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=\x0Ag price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=\x0Ament, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock".=\x0A  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=\x0A share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =\x0Abeneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=\x0Ap. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=\x0Action 6.3.\x0A\x0AThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=\x0A distribution under each of the three interpretations:\x0A\x0A\x0A\x0A\x0ASection 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1\x0A\x0ANumber of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=\x0Aes\x0ARelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13\x0APhantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658\x0A10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866\x0AValue to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792\x0ACurrent stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10\x0ADistribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares\x0A\x0AI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =\x0Aadministrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=\x0A.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =\x0Aa hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =\x0A =20\x0A\x0AIn addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=\x0A same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=\x0Aer.\x0A\x0ASincerely,\x0A\x0A\x0APhillip Allen   =20\x0A=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09

 allen-p/84. column=body:body, timestamp=2022-06-11T16:46:43.287, value=For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a "single sum distribution," in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  \x0A\x0ASection 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.\x0A\x0AAdditionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  \x0A\x0A      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.\x0A

 allen-p/87. column=body:body, timestamp=2022-06-11T16:46:43.524, value=To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:\x0A\x0AYou probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls\x0A(or e-mails). We really do but have been holed up trying to complete\x0Athis project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we\x0Afound that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our\x0Ausers back on-line.\x0A\x0AWe have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked\x0Ayour additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This\x0Aprocess was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100\x0AIBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and\x0Aconfidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying\x0Adata and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of\x0Ayou (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than\x0Aonce or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want\x0Adisplayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or\x0Aphone) the information to us and we will remove this information right\x0Aaway.\x0A\x0ATo our IBS Billpayer clients:\x0A\x0ADuring this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill\x0Apayment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring\x0Apayments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our\x0Ahighest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the\x0Aprocess of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this\x0Ainformation. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the\x0Amonths of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence\x0A(and support).\x0A\x0AAgain, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and\x0Aourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be\x0Aone of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account\x0Ainformation, please refer to the following information:\x0A\x0A1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was\x0Athe correct password) and been given the error message "You have failed\x0Ato correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or\x0Acontact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset." This is\x0Athe easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you\x0Aonline (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you\x0Areceive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for\x0Aeither myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @\x0A830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail\x0A(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back\x0A#.\x0A\x0A2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the\x0Assn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the\x0Alast six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the\x0Aprimary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS\x0Aaccess, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#\x0A(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will\x0Abe directed to a screen that asks for information such as:\x0A\x0AName\x0AAddress\x0ACity, State Zip+4\x0APhone #\x0AE-Mail Address\x0A\x0AAfter entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be\x0Ainstructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can\x0Aat this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always\x0Aremember that your password is case sensitive.\x0A\x0AAgain we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying)\x0Aordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.\x0A\x0ASincerely,\x0A\x0AHoward Gordon\x0ANetwork Manager\x0A\x0A - geninfo.vcf
