## Big Data Coursework 
Author: Yuyan Wu

#### Introduction

This course covers a variety of topics and tools in big data. Most of the topics are about 
the Hadoop ecosystem including Spark, however select databases outside of Hadoop will 
also be considered.  

The coursework demonstrate understanding of distributed computing and databases, implementing algorithms in MapReduce, use of Hive, use of NoSQL database Hbase,
and use of Spark.

Below are the Ovrview for each assignment. 

#### Overviews of Problem Sets

##### Assignment 1

This problem set tests the ability of creating MapReduce jobs to handle tasks including extracting data, cleaning data, 
calculating data summary such as count and standard deviation, and sorting data for Big Data in Hadoops. 

##### Assignment 2

This problem set tests the ability of performing EDA, building model pipeline in SparkSQL and plain Spark (Spark RDDs), and running the jobs in Hadoops.

##### Assignment 3

This problem set must be completed using Amazon Web Services. It requires building a classification model and creating Spark EC2 cluter or using EMR to execuate the task.

##### Assignment 4

This problem set tests the ability of creating Hbase databases and querying data from the databases.
